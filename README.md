Raid Target Icon AddOn for World of Warcraft

Quick Targets is a simple addon for world of warcraft which allows the player to rapidly apply raid target icons to their mouseover targets using a round robin keybind.


How to Install

Extract the directory from the zip into your:
"World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns" directory.

Startup the game and on the character selection screen, open the AddOns using the button ont he bottom left. Ensure the Quick Targets addon is selected. You may need to tick "Load out of date AddOns".


Configuration

Once in the game, open your settings and keybinds. On the left select "Other". Allocate a key for: "Round Robin", "Reset", and "Clear" functions.


How it Works

Press your round robin keybind to set the current icon onto the mouseover target. The AddOn will reset back to the first icon when you leave combat, ensuring it is ready for the next pull. If you agro the next group, you will need to press your clear keybind to reset manually as you will not leave combat!
